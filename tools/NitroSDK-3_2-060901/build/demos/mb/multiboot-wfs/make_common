# Because the MB library samples use the multiboot functionality, 
# development tools with the same communications environment (wired or wireless) are required.  
# The mb_child.bin program in the  
# $NitroSDK/bin/ARM9-TS/Release/ directory provides features equivalent to 
# is a sample that provides the same functionality as a multiboot child on the DS system. 
# Load this binary on the other tools as you would as demo program, 
# and execute it at the same time.
